# Asteroid Shooter
## IT6034 Game Development project. GODOT GAME ENGINE

### Description:
This game is a simple game where you pilot a ship and shoot at oncoming asteroids to destroy thm before
they hit you and break your ship! You move around with the mouse and click to fire lasers that burst the
oncoming rocks.

Collect stars that drop from broken asteroids to earn points, earn enough points and you move to the next
level. There are only two levels, at the end of which you win the game.

Collect green power ups to make the lasers shoot faster for a short period of time, and avoid the red drops,
they will jam your guns!
